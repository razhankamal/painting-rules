# painting-rules
I really enjoy painting to the point where my hands get a little sore. I fall in love with the variety of colors you can integrate with paintings. I personally like to paint different artworks, such as people and places. By people, I mean family, friends, acquaintances, and even strangers. And by places, I mean buildings, sites, countries, and hotspots. I have been experimenting with different techniques for painting, which has been a lot of fun. There's something very satisfying and stress-relieving about creating something on an empty canvas. As to why ðŸŽ¨ rules in the first place!
